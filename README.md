# GitGood practice space

## About this Repository

**This is the "practice space" repository to be used by participants in [The Turing Way GitGood workshops](https://github.com/the-turing-way/gitgood)**

These workshops are designed for people with little to no experience of using Git or GitHub, to introduce you to how it can be used to collaborate on things other than code!

These workshops are interactive and contain exercises where you comment on an issue and submit a pull request to this repository! 

## Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** To normalise reproducible, ethical, and collaborative research as the global standard, ensuring that data science is accessible to and beneficial for all of society.
- **Mission:** To empower a diverse community of practitioners with the technical fluency to use GitHub as a catalyst for reproducible and collaborative research — translating the principles of The Turing Way into research workflows.

## About

Git and GitHub are often thought of as tools for computer scientists or 'people who write code'. At TTW, however, we believe this powerful methdology can be applied to many aspects of your research workflow to make it more transparent, reproducible and collaborative. 

The content of these workshops has evolved over the years, but the overall objective is for participants to be supported in collaborating on materials hosted by The Turing Way. 

### Agenda for the [most recent workshop](https://github.com/the-turing-way/gitgood/tree/main/workshops/202602_OSHO):

- Part 1: What is Git & Github?
- Exercise 1: Finding an Issue and contributing to a project
    - You will practice: Using issues to contribute and document decisions
- Part 2: What is open source?
- Part 3: Using GitHub online and in the terminal (demo)
- Exercise 2: Editing a file and making a Pull Request
    - You will practice: Markdown; contributing, pull requests
- Part 4: What can we make with Github? (Websites and Project Management)
- Exercise 3 (take home): Make your own website
